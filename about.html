          </h2>
          <p class="mb-3">Jasmine Carranza is a wife and mother of three who has found her calling to heal through breastfeeding education in the black community. 
            After being a stay at home mother for three years, in August of 2018 Jasmine accepted a job that would catapult her into the world of breastfeeding. 
            Soon after a spark was ignited into a flame when Jasmine discovered that black women and babies have the lowest breastfeeding rate and the highest mortality rates which could be greatly reduced by breastfeeding. 
            At that point Jasmine’s passion for normalizing breastfeeding in the black community began. 
            In 2019 Jasmine became a Certified Lactation Educator Counselor (CLEC) and began her journey to complete her Bachelors in Maternal child health with a focus on Human Lactation. 
            Early on in 2020 Jasmine founded and launched Golden Journey Empowerment along with co-founder Adia Gipson.</p>

          </h2>
          <p class="mb-3">Adia Gipson has been helping mothers with breastfeeding for over 18 years. She grew up in Richmond, California, and moved to Sacramento in 1994. 
            She married my college sweetheart 22 years ago, and together they have two sons, ages 20 and 17.</p>
          <p class="mb-3">Adia has a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology and a Master’s degree in Health and Wellness with a focus in Lactation Studies, 
            both from Union Institute and University. She also did training to become a doula, and completed her lactation internship at UC Davis Medical Center. 
            She earned herIBCLC (International Board Certified Lactation Consultant) certification in 2018, and Dignity Health and Kaiser Permanente 
            currently employ her as a Lactation Consultant and Health Educator II.</p>
          <p class="mb-3">Her breastfeeding journey started after she give birth to her eldest son in 2000. Adia had the desire to breastfeed her child but had no idea how to do it. 
            With no African American role models around her and no one else in her family to guide her on breastfeeding, she went on a quest to find 
            information and resources through books and magazines articles. Adia's husband and mother were her biggest supporters. They knew how vital breastfeeding became for her, 
            and she succeeded  breastfeeding with her first son for 14 months and her second son for 10 months.</p>
          <p class="mb-3">Because of the struggles she faced on her journey, she made a vow to help the mothers in her circle with breastfeeding. 
            Today, she is fulfilling her promise and assisting mothers in her community and circle by being one of the founders of Golden Journey Empowerment.</p>
