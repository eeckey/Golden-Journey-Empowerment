          </h2>
          <p class="mb-3">Jasmine Carranza is a wife and mother of three who has found her calling to heal through breastfeeding education in the black community. 
            After being a stay at home mother for three years, in August of 2018 Jasmine accepted a job that would catapult her into the world of breastfeeding. 
            Soon after a spark was ignited into a flame when Jasmine discovered that black women and babies have the lowest breastfeeding rate and the highest mortality rates which could be greatly reduced by breastfeeding. 
            At that point Jasmine’s passion for normalizing breastfeeding in the black community began. 
            In 2019 Jasmine became a Certified Lactation Educator Counselor (CLEC) and began her journey to complete her Bachelors in Maternal child health with a focus on Human Lactation. 
            Early on in 2020 Jasmine founded and launched Golden Journey Empowerment along with co-founder Adia Gipson.</p>
          <p class="mb-3"> Since the launch, UC Davis clinical and health services researchers, in collaboration with Golden Journey Empowerment are conducting a study seeking to examine the lived experience 
            of pregnancy and breastfeeding among postpartum Black women in Sacramento. Guidance from local women will help UC Davis researchers identify ways to improve clinical care provided to Black mothers 
            and to develop culturally-appropriate interventions to improve breastfeeding rates and reduce perinatal disparities throughout Sacramento and the state of California.</p>

          </h2>
          <p class="mb-3">Hello! My name is Adia Gipson, and I have been helping mothers with breastfeeding for over 18 years. I grew up in Richmond, California, and moved to Sacramento in 1994. 
            I married my college sweetheart 22 years ago, and together we have two sons, ages 20 and 17.</p>
          <p class="mb-3">I have a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology and a Master’s degree in Health and Wellness with a focus in Lactation Studies, both from Union Institute and University. 
            I also did training to become a doula, and I completed my lactation internship at UC Davis Medical Center. 
            I earned my IBCLC (International Board Certified Lactation Consultant) certification in 2018, and Dignity Health and Kaiser Permanente currently employ me as a Lactation Consultant and Health Educator II.</p>
          <p class="mb-3">My breastfeeding journey started after giving birth to my eldest son in 2000. I had the desire to breastfeed my child but had no idea how to do it. 
            With no African American role models around me and no one in my family to guide me on breastfeeding, I went on a quest to find information and resources through books and magazines articles. 
            My husband and my mother were my biggest supporters. They knew how vital breastfeeding became for me, and I succeeded with breastfeeding my first son for 14 months and my second son for 10 months.</p>
          <p class="mb-3">Because of the struggles I faced on my journey, I made a vow to help the mothers in my circle with breastfeeding. 
            Today, I am fulfilling my promise and assisting mothers in my community and circle by being one of the founders of Golden Journey Empowerment.</p>
