            <p class="mb-0">"Adia Gipson is the best!! I saw Adia while still in the hospital with my newborn. I was seriously scared to try to nurse my new baby because this girl came out of the womb like a hungry piranha. 
              I mean she was seriously sucking the air or her hands furiously and I just knew she was going to tear my nipples up. So I waited for Adia. She showed up and reassured me that I could do it and that my baby wasn’t going to suck my nipples off. 
              She was calm, supportive, and encouraging. She listened to my concerns/fears. She was also gentle (not grabbing my breast and awkwardly shoving it in my babies mouth). I felt at ease and not tense with her as my lactation consultant. 
              You can tell right away that she’s just a very kind person who seriously loves her profession and cares about her clients. She’s an expert in her field for sure. I highly recommend her to anyone looking for lactation support."</p>

              But having Jasmine eased all of my doubts and fears. From checking in on me outside of our scheduled calls and helping me revise my birth plan to include the new hospital Covid-19 protocols. Jasmine makes all of the connections."</p>

            <p class="mb-0">"Where do I even begin? Breastfeeding journey??? Naw it was an ADVENTURE! Struggling was not the word. My journey was so hard in the beginning I was literally in tears daily, sometimes hourly, because the pain was so unbearable. 
              If you’ve never experienced a baby with a shallow latch then thank your lucky stars. I had been contemplating daily in if it was worth it to just suck it up and go through the pain or just to throw in the towel and reach for the formula. 
              The few times that I had to supplement with formula I broke down in tears, especially the first two times. I had gone to the Lactation Clinic so many times that many of the ladies knew my name, my baby’s name, and my medical number. 
              It was terrible. Even though I had gone so many times they still were not 'hearing' me. Fast forward I reach out to one of my far away Nurse / Lactation friends ( Miesha aka Nursemilk) who reaches out to her network and she introduces me to Adia. 
              I know when it comes to race people get all bent out of shape, but I definitely needed a BLACK lactation consultant who could relate to me culturally... this was a Godsend. When I first met Adia I had no idea what to expect. I was at my wit’s end and I just needed help. 
              I don’t usually warm up to people right away, but with Adia it felt like a big sister or an auntie type of vibe. It just felt “comfortable”.  You have no idea how much relief was felt just being reassured that I wasn’t crazy, being reassured that it was worth it, 
              and most important... being heard! She was one of the biggest supporters in my village and the relationship felt more like family than business. She went above and beyond what her fee included and I am so grateful that she continues to be one of my biggest cheerleaders. 
              I would highly recommend Golden Empowerment Journey!"</p>

            <p class="mb-0">"Hi my name is Ebony and I must start out by saying Mrs. Adia was heaven sent. She is my Lactation Angel! Why do I say that? Well let me tell you. Going into the start of my labor, I had it rocky, but earlier on, she assured me on what to expect, 
              what classes to attend and what things I would need so I felt comfortable. I was a first time mom but when she was finished with me, I felt like a super woman.  When labor time came, I was having a difficult time laboring but she was there with me 
              every step of the way teaching me techniques on getting my labor pain under control. We walked, we talked and we prayed during my labor process. While in the hospital, I was able to work with great medical staff but I also encountered some staff that wasn’t so helpful. 
              I was sent home unable to latch my daughter to breastfeed. I didn’t know exactly what to do so I ended up feeding her with a syringe and hand expressed milk. Oh my God, the shame I felt as a new mom. 
              I knew this wasn’t right because my baby cried like nobody’s business on her first night home. As a mother, I was determined to solve my breastfeeding issues. Thankfully for me, my Lactation Angel (Mrs. Adia) came to my rescue…fast, quick and in a hurry. 
              She assured me that everything would be ok.  Mrs. Adia ran to the store and purchased me a manual breast pump. Wow! I was able to discover all my liquid gold.  I was amazed with the amount of milk I was able to pump and from then on, it’s been milk heaven ever since! 
              Let me tell you, when I went back to the doctor for my daughter’s checkup, the doctor didn’t even recognize that it was the same child. She is a chunky and healthy girl. Thank you so much Mrs. Adia! No, take that back, Mrs. Adia is my Auntie now! 
              I recommend any breastfeeding or future breastfeeding mothers to go check her out. She the Bomb.com!!" </p>
