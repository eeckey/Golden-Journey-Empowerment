            <p class="mb-0">Where do I even begin? Breastfeeding journey??? Naw it was an ADVENTURE! Struggling was not the word. My journey was so hard in the beginning I was literally in tears daily, sometimes hourly, because the pain was so unbearable. 
              If you’ve never experienced a baby with a shallow latch then thank your lucky stars. I had been contemplating daily in if it was worth it to just suck it up and go through the pain or just to throw in the towel and reach for the formula. 
              The few times that I had to supplement with formula I broke down in tears, especially the first two times. I had gone to the Lactation Clinic so many times that many of the ladies knew my name, my baby’s name, and my medical number. 
              It was terrible. Even though I had gone so many times they still were not “hearing” me. Fast forward I reach out to one of my far away Nurse / Lactation friends ( Miesha aka Nursemilk) who reaches out to her network and she introduces me to Adia. 
              I know when it comes to race people get all bent out of shape, but I definitely needed a BLACK lactation consultant who could relate to me culturally... this was a Godsend. When I first met Adia I had no idea what to expect. I was at my wit’s end and I just needed help. 
              I don’t usually warm up to people right away, but with Adia it felt like a big sister or an auntie type of vibe. It just felt “comfortable”.  You have no idea how much relief was felt just being reassured that I wasn’t crazy, being reassured that it was worth it, 
              and most important... being heard! She was one of the biggest supporters in my village and the relationship felt more like family than business. She went above and beyond what her fee included and I am so grateful that she continues to be one of my biggest cheerleaders. 
              I would highly recommend Golden Empowerment Journey!</p>
