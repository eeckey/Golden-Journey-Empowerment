            <p class="mb-0">"Adia Gipson is the best!! I saw Adia while still in the hospital with my newborn. I was seriously scared to try to nurse my new baby because this girl came out of the womb like a hungry piranha. 
              I mean she was seriously sucking the air or her hands furiously and I just knew she was going to tear my nipples up. So I waited for Adia. She showed up and reassured me that I could do it and that my baby wasn’t going to suck my nipples off. 
              She was calm, supportive, and encouraging. She listened to my concerns/fears. She was also gentle (not grabbing my breast and awkwardly shoving it in my babies mouth). I felt at ease and not tense with her as my lactation consultant. 
              You can tell right away that she’s just a very kind person who seriously loves her profession and cares about her clients. She’s an expert in her field for sure. I highly recommend her to anyone looking for lactation support."</p>

              But having Jasmine eased all of my doubts and fears. From checking in on me outside of our scheduled calls and helping me revise my birth plan to include the new hospital Covid-19 protocols. Jasmine makes all of the connections."</p>

            <p class="mb-0">"Where do I even begin? Breastfeeding journey??? Naw it was an ADVENTURE! Struggling was not the word. My journey was so hard in the beginning I was literally in tears daily, sometimes hourly, because the pain was so unbearable. 
              If you’ve never experienced a baby with a shallow latch then thank your lucky stars. I had been contemplating daily in if it was worth it to just suck it up and go through the pain or just to throw in the towel and reach for the formula. 
              The few times that I had to supplement with formula I broke down in tears, especially the first two times. I had gone to the Lactation Clinic so many times that many of the ladies knew my name, my baby’s name, and my medical number. 
              It was terrible. Even though I had gone so many times they still were not 'hearing' me. Fast forward I reach out to one of my far away Nurse / Lactation friends ( Miesha aka Nursemilk) who reaches out to her network and she introduces me to Adia. 
              I know when it comes to race people get all bent out of shape, but I definitely needed a BLACK lactation consultant who could relate to me culturally... this was a Godsend. When I first met Adia I had no idea what to expect. I was at my wit’s end and I just needed help. 
              I don’t usually warm up to people right away, but with Adia it felt like a big sister or an auntie type of vibe. It just felt “comfortable”.  You have no idea how much relief was felt just being reassured that I wasn’t crazy, being reassured that it was worth it, 
              and most important... being heard! She was one of the biggest supporters in my village and the relationship felt more like family than business. She went above and beyond what her fee included and I am so grateful that she continues to be one of my biggest cheerleaders. 
              I would highly recommend Golden Empowerment Journey!"</p>

            <p class="mb-0">"Hi my name is Ebony an I must start by saying Ms.Adia was heaven sent she is my Lactation Angel! Why do I say that, we’ll let me tell you! Going into the start of my labor I had it rocky but she assured me on what to expect what classes to attend what things I would need so I felt comfortable first time mom an when she was finished with me I felt like super woman! 
              labor time came I was having a difficult time laboring but she was there every step of the way teaching me techniques on getting the lightning strikes called labor pain in control! We walked we talked we prayed 3 days later we went into labor an there was my daughter she was here! 
              In the hospital I received some good people in my process but also there was bad an when I say bad I mean that I was being sent home unable to latch my daughter, I didn’t no exactly how so I would try to feed her out of a syringe, oh my god the shame I felt I knew this wasn’t right because the first night my bad cried like nobody’s bussiness, 
              an for any mother to solve what’s going on with your child we would do anything! But thankfully for me! My Lactation Angel! She came to my rescue! I called Ms.Adia in my distress an she came fast quick an in a hurry! She assured me everything would be ok my baby just needs more milk, she ran to the store got me a manual pump! An oh my goodness! 
              I discovered all the liquid gold that was in my boobies, I was amazed an from then on it’s been Milk Heaven ever since! Let me tell you went back to the doctor for checkup the doctor didn’t even recognize that it was the same child! She is a chunky girl but most of all healthy an loved! Thank youuuuuu so much Ms.Adia!!! 
              Nope take that back that my Auntie now! And any breastfeeding or future breastfeeding mother go check her out she the Bomb.com!!" </p>
